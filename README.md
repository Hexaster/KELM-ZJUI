KELM is a website imitating other AI websites such as chatGPT and whatnot. So far it is still very rudimentary.

1. Clone the repo.
```
git clone https://github.com/Hexaster/KELM-ZJUI.git
cd KELM-ZJUI
```
2. Install any required libraries.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the server
```aiignore
python manage.py runserver
```
4. Open http://127.0.0.1:8000/
